# Refactor Summary Report

This document provides a high-level summary of the refactoring and optimization work performed on the GovPro Assistant application.

## Key Improvements

1.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   React component re-rendering has been optimized by memoizing all handler functions in the main `App.tsx` component using `useCallback`. This prevents unnecessary re-renders of child components, leading to a more performant and responsive user interface, especially in the `Dashboard`, `Workflow`, and `Settings` pages.
    *   Corrected the dependency array for the memoized `renderPage` function to ensure it uses the latest state and props, preventing stale closures and bugs.

2.  **Code Quality and Best Practices:**
    *   The `DiagramGenerator` component was refactored to correctly handle and display any valid MermaidJS syntax returned by the AI model. The previous implementation incorrectly assumed all diagrams would be of type `graph TD`, which was brittle. The component is now more robust and correctly renders various diagram types (e.g., sequence diagrams, flowcharts).

3.  **Security Posture:**
    *   No critical security vulnerabilities were identified in the codebase during this review. The application correctly handles API keys via environment variables and does not expose sensitive information on the client side. The primary focus of this refactor was on performance and code quality.
